The hierarchical highlight journalling system is as follows:
- Near the end of the day, write a single sentence containing your highlight of that day.
- At the end of the week, look back at your daily highlights. Select your favourite to be your highlight of the week.
- At the end of the month, look back at the weekly highlights. Select your favourite to be your highlight of the month.
- At the end of the year, look back at your monthly highlights. Select your favourite to be your highlight of the year.

Some benefits of the sytem:
- Brevity
- Quick to write / work with
- The best items bubble up, (your favourite favourites...)
- Can choose level of detail to look back across, (years / months / weeks / days)
- Helps with being conscious of positive moments
- Helps with remembering and looking back on positive moments
- Easier to stick with than more verbose journalling
- Easy to come back to, (could fill in gaps at a higher level, e.g. just the weeks / months, etc.)
- Missing the odd day / week / month / year doesn't matter too much, if there's still a enough highlights to choose from
