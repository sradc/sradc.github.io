Introducing [write-on.io](https://write-on.io/), a small (tiny) productivity web app for writers. 


> This app is to help keep the drafting phase of writing separate from the editing phase.
> It prevents you from going back. You can only write on.
> Don't worry about mistakes until the draft is done. Build momentum and get into the flow. You may find you are more productive if you don't edit as you write.
