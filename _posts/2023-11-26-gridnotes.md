Gridnotes (working title) is an infinite 2D text editor.

If you are using Firefox or Chrome, on Desktop, try out the demo: [here](https://gridnotes.io/v1/)

## Features

Typing on an infinite grid.

/>
</p>

Teleportation using written coordinates, (enabling warp loops).

Opening links.

/>
</p>

Plus a few more bonus features, e.g. newline behaviour, alt + backspace deletion, etc.

## Notes

Text is stored locally, in the browser.

I made most of this demo in January of this year, and realised I should just ship, and start getting feedback.

## Inspirations

- [Orca](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/orca.html) <- a 2-dimensional programming language for making music
- Infinite 2D canvas tools such as Excalidraw, Obsidian canvas, Miro, Lucidchart, Freeform etc.
