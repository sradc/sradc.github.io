## Notes

I made most of this demo in January of this year, and recently realised I should just ship.

## Inspirations

- [Orca](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/orca.html) <- a 2-dimensional programming language for making music
- Infinite 2D canvas tools such as Excalidraw, Obsidian canvas, Miro, Lucidchart, Freeform etc.  -->
