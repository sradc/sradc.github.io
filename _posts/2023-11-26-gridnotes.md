Gridnotes is an infinite 2D text editor I made.

If you are using Firefox or Chrome, on Desktop, try out the demo: [here](https://gridnotes.io/v1/)

## Features

Typing on an infinite grid.

    alt="Image showing typing on the grid"
/>
</p>

Teleportation using written coordinates, (enabling warp loops).

/>
</p>


Opening links.

    alt="Image showing using links"
/>
</p>

Plus a few more bonus features, e.g. newline behaviour, alt + backspace deletion, etc.

Text is stored locally, in the browser.

## Inspirations

- [Orca](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/orca.html) <- a two-dimensional programming language for making music
- Infinite 2D canvas tools such as Excalidraw, Obsidian canvas, Miro, Lucidchart, Freeform etc.
