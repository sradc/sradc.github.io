I bring you a message on their behalf.

**The volume slider at the bottom of YouTube videos, that disappears while the video is playing?**

They can't find it. They don't know about it. And after being told about it, they can't remember it.

**Burger menus?**

Three decorative lines.

**Menus that appear on Zoom, only when hovering the cursor over the window, or tapping the screen?**

Yeah, no.

The solution seems obvious: light mode, dark mode, and "I am old, don't hide things" mode.

Although, I have merely been aiding persons of large age, and have not carried out a study.

UI designers, spare a thought, if not for the ancients, for those who walk among them (digitally, due to the pandemic).
