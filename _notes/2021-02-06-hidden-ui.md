I bring you a message on behalf of the old ones.

**The volume slider at the bottom of YouTube videos, that disappears while the video is playing?**

They can't find it. They don't know about it. And after being told about it, they can't remember it.

**Burger menus?**

Three decorative lines.

**Menus that appear on Zoom, only when hovering the cursor over the window, or tapping the screen?**

Yeah, no.

Solution?: light mode, dark mode, and "I am old, don't hide things" mode.

UI designers, spare a thought, for the ancient ones, and those who walk among them.
