### [The Architecture of Open Source Applications.](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)
Tags: book, programming, software, architecture, code.
Date added: 2020-06-30.
>  Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes. 

A series of books, available to read for free. Chapters contributed by developers of open source. Contains cool things, like [A Python Interpreter Written in Python](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html).
